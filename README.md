# **How Much Risk Is in the Economy?**

risk


## **Project Mission**

without a doubt, this is a million-dollar question that a lot of experts in the financial industry place their own bets based on throughout but unavoidably limited research. the cost of getting the absolutely right answer, even if achievable, is extremely high and almost impossible for the public. However, we still need to make our life choices every single day without adequate information.

should i go back to school? should i take the plunge and quit, in order to find the dream job? what will the job market look like tomorrow? should i invest in homeownership now?

**disclaimers** first, this project won't be able to offer you answers to every single question. But i do hope to translate financial industry knowledge into accesible visualization and numbers, and offer some assistance in your decision-making process.

ok, so how is this project supposed to achieve that?

## **Project Design**

**first off,** we need to redifine the question into a subset of data-rich, programmable questions.

instead of the air-like, untangible 'risk', we use one of its closest proxy - stock market performance - which is directly relevant to a lot of your questions on investment, be it property or stock or retirement funds.

another risk indicator is the steepness/slope of treasury yield curve. conventionaly wisdom in the financial industry believes that the difference of 10 year and 3 month treasury bill rates are most powerful indicator on the yield curve, which we will test and assess.

the last risk indicator is quite well-defined - The VIX Index constructed by Chicago Board Options Exchange, is used as a barometer for market uncertainty.

therefore, we **re-define** the question of "what is the risk level of our current economy?" to "what is tomorrow's stock market performance based on historical volatility and the shape of treasury yield curves?"

## **Data**

the data I have available is [S&P500 historical index](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history/) from Yahoo Finance, [Daily Treasury Yield Curve](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield) from United States Department of Treasury, and [CBOE Volatility Index](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EVIX/)
